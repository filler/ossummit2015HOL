#Cloud Foundry on OpenStack Hands-On Labs

##Exercise 1: Target the Cloud Foundry instance

Make sure you've installed the stackato CLI and created an alias for accessing the Cloud Foundry instance.

Target the Cloud Foundry instance by substituting the URL with the one provided and use the following command.

```
cf target https://api.15.126.133.139.xip.io
```

The output should look something like below.

```
Successfully targeted to [https://api.15.126.133.139.xip.io]
Target:       https://api.15.126.133.139.xip.io
Organization: workshop
Space:        workshop
```

You can log in with the following command. Login credentials will be provided.

```
cf login username
```

The output will look something line below.

```
Attempting login to [https://api.15.126.133.139.xip.io]
Password:
Successfully logged into [https://api.15.126.133.139.xip.io]
Target:       https://api.15.126.133.139.xip.io
Organization: org
Space:        space
```


You can verify that you are targeted and logged in by running with the following command.

```
cf apps
```

and the services that are installed with the following command.

```
cf marketplace
```

You should see an output that lists the different services and the plans that have been pre-installed for your convenience.

```

You can also try additional options for the CLI.
